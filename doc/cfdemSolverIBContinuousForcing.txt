cfdemSolverIBContinuousForcing command :h3

[Description:]

"cfdemSolverIBContinuousForcing" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using CFDEMcoupling,
an open-source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework, for calculating the dynamics
between immersed bodies and the surrounding fluid. Being an implementation of a
continuous forcing immersed boundary method it allows tackling problems where
the body diameter exceeds the maximal size of a fluid cell.

Using the toolbox of OpenFOAM&reg;(*) the governing equations of the fluid are
computed and the corrections of velocity and pressure field with respect to the
body-movement information, gained from LIGGGHTS, are incorporated.

The code of this solver was contributed by A.N. Balachandran Nair, JKU. For more
details, see "Balachandran Nair et al. (2021)"_#BalachandranNair2021

[Use:]

The solver is realized within the open-source framework CFDEMcoupling. Just as
for the unresolved CFD-DEM solver cfdemSolverPiso the file
CFD/constant/couplingProperties contains information about the settings for the
different models. While IOmodel, DataExchangeModel etc. are applicable for all
CFDEMcoupling-solvers, special locate-, force- and void fraction models were
designed for this solver:

"engineSearchIB"_locateModel_engineSearchIB.html,
"ArchimedesIB"_forceModel_ArchimedesIB.html,
"ShirgaonkarIB"_forceModel_ShirgaonkarIB.html,
"IBVoidfraction"_voidFractionModel_IBVoidFraction.html
