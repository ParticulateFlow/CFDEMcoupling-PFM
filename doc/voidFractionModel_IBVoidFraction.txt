voidFractionModel IB command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

voidFractionModel IB;
IBProps
\{
    maxCellsPerParticle number1;
    alphaMin            number2;
    scaleUpVol          number3;
\} :pre

{number1} = maximum number of cells covered by a particle (search will fail when
more than {number1} cells are covered by the particle) :ulb,l
{number2} = minimum limit for void fraction :l
{number3} = diameter of the particle's representation is artificially increased
according to {number3} * Vparticle, volume remains unaltered! :l
:ule

[Examples:]

voidFractionModel IB;
IBProps
\{
    maxCellsPerParticle 1000;
    alphaMin            0.10;
    scaleUpVol          5.0;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The {IB} void fraction model is supposed to be used when a particle (or its
representation) is bigger than a CFD cell. The void fraction field is set in
those cell whose centres are inside the particle. The model is specially
designed for cfdemSolverIB and creates a smooth transition of the void fraction
at the particle surface. Cells which are only partially covered by solid are
marked by void fraction values between 0 and 1 respectively.

The region of influence of a particle can be increased artificially by
"scaleUpVol", which blows up the particles, but keeps their volume (for
void fraction calculation) constant.

Code of this sub-model was contributed by Alice Hager, JKU.
