forceModel surfaceTensionForce command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

forceModels
(
    surfaceTensionForce;
);
surfaceTensionForceProps
\{
    stfFieldName "surfaceTensionField";
\} :pre

{surfaceTensionField} = name of the surface tension force field :ulb,l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    surfaceTensionForce;
);
surfaceTensionForceProps
\{
    stfFieldName "surfaceTensionForce";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model calculates the surface tension force acting on each DEM particle
based on a pre-calculated surface tension force as V_particle * F^sigma. When
used in conjunction with the "cfdemSolverMultiphase"_cfdemSolverMultiphase.html
solver, the surface tension force is calculated with the CSF (continuum surface
force) model (see Brackbill et al. (1992): "A continuum method for modeling
surface tension", J. Comput. Phys.).

[Restrictions:]

Has to be used with a multiphase solver that calculates the surface tension
force, e.g. {cfdemSolverMultiphase}.
