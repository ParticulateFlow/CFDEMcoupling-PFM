[Description:]

An effective gravitational source term, {gravityEff}, that is necessery to drive the flow only in
case of periodic box simulations. This source term is added to the momentum equation. In case of
simulating periodic boxes with assuming "Homogenous no flow condition" we will have:

This equation depicts that in "no flow condition" static pressure gradient balances the mixture weight.
Therefore, to derive the flow in the periodic box simulations, a dynamic pressure gradient is defined as,

:c,image(Eqs/otherForceModels_gravityEff_pic2.jpg)

If one replaces the static pressure gradient of the fluid momentum equation with,

:c,image(Eqs/otherForceModels_gravityEff_pic3.jpg)

The fluid momentum equation solved in case of periodic box simulations will be,

:c,image(Eqs/otherForceModels_gravityEff_pic4.jpg)

The {gravityEff} source term is the third term in the RHS of the momentum equation. Note that 
the gravitational body force of the fluid momentum equation is considered with this source term.

In the basic implementation of {gravityEff}, first we calculate the density of the mixture and then
the source term is calculated based on the third term in the RHS of the momentum equation.
