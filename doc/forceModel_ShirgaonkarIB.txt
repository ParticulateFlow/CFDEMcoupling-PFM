forceModel ShirgaonkarIB command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

forceModels
(
    ShirgaonkarIB
);
ShirgaonkarIBProps
\{
    velFieldName      "U";
    pressureFieldName "pressure";
    twoDimensional;
    useTorque;
    treatForceExplicit switch1;
\} :pre

{U} = name of the finite volume fluid velocity field :ulb,l
{pressure} = name of the finite volume pressure field :l
{twoDimensional} = optional keyword for conducting a two dimensional calculation :l
{useTorque} =  optional keyword for calculating particle torque :l
{switch1} = (optional, default false) sub model switch, see "forceSubModel"_forceSubModel.html for details :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    ShirgaonkarIB
);
ShirgaonkarIBProps
\{
    velFieldName "U";
    pressureFieldName "p";
\} :pre

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle
interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. The {ShirgaonkarIB} model
calculates the drag force (viscous and pressure force) acting on each particle
in a resolved manner (see "Shirgaonkar et al. (2009)"_#Shirgaonkar2009).
This model is only suited for resolved CFD-DEM simulations where
the particle is represented by immersed boundary method.

[Restrictions:]

Only for immersed boundary solvers.
