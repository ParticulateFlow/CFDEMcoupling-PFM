forceModel command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

forceModels
(
    model_x
    model_y
); :pre

model = name of force model to be applied :ul

[Examples:]

forceModels
(

    DiFeliceDrag
); :pre

NOTE: This examples list might not be complete - please look for other models
(forceModel XY) in this documentation.

[Description:]

The force model performs the calculation of forces (e.g. fluid-particle
interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle. All force models selected are
executed sequentially and the forces on the particles are superposed. If the
fluid density field is needed, by default a field named "rho" will be used. Via
the forceSubModel an alternative field can be chosen.

[Restrictions:]

none
