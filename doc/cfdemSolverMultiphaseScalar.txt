cfdemSolverMultiphaseScalar command :h3

[Description:]

<!-- HTML_ONLY -->
"cfdemSolverMultiphaseScalar" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using the CFDEMcoupling framework. Based on the OpenFOAM solver multiphaseInterFoam&reg;(*) it has functionality to simulate several fluids using the Volume of Fluid approach, coupled with the DEM code LIGGGHTS for solid particles. Additionally, it enable evaluation of temperature and dissolved species concentration fields.
