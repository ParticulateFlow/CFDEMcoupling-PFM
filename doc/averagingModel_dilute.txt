averagingModel dilute command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

averagingModel dilute; :pre

[Examples:]

averagingModel dilute; :pre

[Description:]

The averaging model performs the Lagrangian->Eulerian mapping of data (e.g.
particle velocities).
In the "cfdemParticle cloud" this averaging model is used to calculate the
average particle velocity inside a CFD cell. The {dilute} model is supposed to
be applied to cases where the granular regime is rather dilute. The particle
velocity inside a CFD cell is evaluated from a single particle in a cell (no
averaging).

[Restrictions:]

This model is computationally efficient but should only be used when only one
particle is inside one CFD cell.
