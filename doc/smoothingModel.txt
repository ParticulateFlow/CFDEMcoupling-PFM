smoothingModel command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

smoothingModel model; :pre

model = name of the smoothingModel to be applied :ul

[Examples:]

smoothingModel off;
smoothingModel constDiffSmoothing; :pre

NOTE: This examples list might not be complete - please look for other models
(smoothingModel XY) in this documentation.

IMPORTANT NOTE: In case a smoothing model is used in conjunction with
"PimpleImEx" solvers, the fields "f" and "fSmooth" must be placed in the initial
time directory! This is because zeroGradient boundary conditions for the fields
"f" and "fSmooth" must be specified, otherwise the smoothing operation will give
an error.

[Description:]

The {smoothingModel} is the base class for models that smoothen the exchange
fields (i.e., void fraction and the Ksl field in case of implicit force coupling).
This is relevant in case one uses a small grid resolution compared to the local
particle diameter (or parcel diameter in case one uses a parcel approach).

[Restrictions:]

These models are in beta testing.

[Default:]

none
