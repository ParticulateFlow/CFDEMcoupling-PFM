dictionary.

{forceModeli} = list of force models in the simulation, the particleProbe will be applied to all of these models! :ulb,l
{particleIDsToSample} = list of particle IDs to be sampled. :l
{verboseToFile} = main switch to activate the particle probe (default = off). :l
{verbose} = main switch to activate output to Info (currently not implemented). :l
{xEvery} = integer to specify the interval for sampling (default = 1, i.e., probing occurs every CFD time step). :l
{sampleAll} = switch to activate sampling of all particles. Otherwise (default) only particles specified via "particleIDsToSample" in the couplingProperties dictionary will be sampled. :l

{probeDebug} = switch to activate probing of debug properties of secondary importance (specific for each force model). :l
{includePosition} = switch to add the particle position in the log file (default = off). :l
{xPrecision} = number of significant digits of the text output (default = 3). :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    gradPForce
); :pre

probeModel particleProbe; :pre

particleProbeProps
\{
    particleIDsToSample (0 1 2 3);
    verboseToFile;    // main switch
    verbose;          // currently not used
    printEvery 100;   // print every this many CFD time steps
    sampleAll;        // activate sampling for all particles
    probeDebug;       // probes additional fields
    includePosition;  // will include particle position in the output file
    writePrecision 4; // number of significant digits to print
\}; :pre

NOTE: This examples list might not be complete - please check below for the list
of models that can perform particle probing.

[Description:]

The {particleProbe} feature keeps track of per-particle quantities (e.g., the
fluid-particle interaction forces) acting on each DEM particle, and handles its
storage during the simulation. Data is saved in the 
$caseDir/CFD/particleProbes/startTime directory, where {startTime} is the time
at which the simulation is started (this avoids unwanted deletion of
particleProbe data).

[Restrictions:]

none

[Related commands:]

The following force models are currently enabled for particle probing:

"MeiLift"_forceModel_MeiLift.html, that is most of the forceModels, see the
{src} directory for details, i.e. use

grep -r 'probeM(' ./ :pre

in a CLI terminal.

[Default:]
