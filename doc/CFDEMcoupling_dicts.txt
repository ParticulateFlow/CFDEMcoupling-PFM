4. Dictionaries :link(1_4),h3

4.1 couplingProperties dictionary :link(couplingProperties),h4

[General:]

In the {couplingProperties} dictionary the setup of the coupling routines of the
CFD-DEM simulation are defined.

[Location:] $caseDir/CFD/constant

[Structure:]

The dictionary is divided into two parts, "sub-models & settings" and "sub-model
properties".

In "sub-models & settings" the following routines must be specified:

modelType :ulb,l
couplingInterval :l
voidFractionModel :l
locateModel :l
meshMotionModel :l
regionModel :l
IOModel :l
dataExchangeModel :l
averagingModel :l
forceModels :l
momCoupleModels :l
turbulenceModelType :l
:ule

In "sub-model properties" sub-dictionaries might be defined to specify model
specific parameters.

[Settings:]

Reasonable example settings for the {couplingProperties} dictionary are given in
the tutorial cases.

modelType :pre

{modelType} refers to the formulation of the equations to be solved. Choose "A",
"B" or "Bfull", according to "Zhou et al. (2010)"_#Zhou2010. Model "A" requires
the use of the force models gradPForce and viscForce, whereas "B" requires the
force model "Archimedes". "Bfull" refers to model type I.

couplingInterval :pre

The coupling interval determines the time passing between two CFD-DEM data
exchanges.

A useful procedure would be:

Set the DEM time step in the LIGGGHTS input file according to the needs of the
pure DEM problem. :olb,l
Set the {couplingInterval}, which refers to the DEM time steps. Depending on the
problem you will need to have a close (small couplingInterval) or loose
coupling. :l
Choose the CFD time step in the controlDict. It must be equal to or smaller than
the coupling time, otherwise you will get the error: "Error - TS bigger than
coupling interval!". :l,ole

[Example:]

Choosing DEMts=0.00001s and couplingInterval=10 means that an exchange of data
(=coupling) will happen every 0.0001s.

4.2 liggghtsCommands dictionary :link(liggghtsCommands),h4

[General:]

In the {liggghtsCommands} dictionary LIGGGHTS commands which are to be executed
during a coupled CFD-DEM simulation are specified.

[Location:] $caseDir/CFD/constant

[Structure:]

The dictionary is divided into two parts, first a list of
"liggghtsCommandModels"_CFDEMcoupling_models.html#lcm is defined, then the
settings for each model must be specified.

[Settings:]

Reasonable example settings for the {liggghtsCommands} dictionary are given in
the tutorial cases.
