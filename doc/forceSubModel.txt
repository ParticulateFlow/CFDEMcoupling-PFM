forceSubModels command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
sub-dictionary of the force model in use. If no force sub-model is applied, ImEx
is used as default. If the keyword "forceSubModels" is provided, a choice of
sub-model is demanded.

forceSubModels
(
    model_x
    model_y
); :pre

model = name of force sub-model to be applied :ul

[Examples:]

forceSubModels
(
    ImEx
); :pre

NOTE: This examples list might not be complete - please look for other models
(forceSubModel XY) in this documentation.

[Description:]

The force sub model is designed to hold the settings a force model can have.
Depending on the availability within the respective force model, the following
options are handled:

{treatForceExplicit} - switch for the purely explicit consideration of the force
term in the equation of motion on the CFD side (off -> the force is considered
semi-implicitly; default off) :ulb,l
{treatForceDEM} - switch for the consideration of the forces on the DEM side only
(off -> calculate forces for DEM and CFD; default off) :l
{implForceDEM} - If true, the fluid velocity and drag coefficient are communicated
to the DEM calculation at each coupling time step and the drag force is
calculated at each DEM time step, using the current particle velocity.
If false, a force term is communicated to the DEM calculation at each coupling
time step, the term is constant for one coupling interval.
(on -> DEM forces are updated every DEM step; default off) :l
{verbose} - switch for debug output to screen (on -> enable debug output; default
off) :l
{interpolation} - switch for the usage of interpolation models when getting data
for the Lagrangian calculation from Eulerian fields;
f false, the cell centre values are used. (default off) :l
{useFilteredDragModel} - switch for using a coarse-grid version of the Beetstra
drag model (takes grid-size effects into account; default = off) :l
{useParcelSizeDependentFilteredDrag} - switch for using a coarse-grid version of
the Beetstra drag model (takes parcel-size effects into account, will force the
switch useFilteredDragModel to "on"; default = off) :l
{implForceDEMaccumulated} - Can only be used in combination with implForceDEM
switch, drag force values of each DEM time step are accumulated and passed on to
the CFD-calculation. (default off) :l
{scalarViscosity} - switch for the usage of a user-defined viscosity nu for the
calculation of the drag force; The CFD calculation always uses the value of the
transport model. (off -> use transportProperties nu; default off) :l
:ule
