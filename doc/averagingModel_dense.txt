averagingModel dense command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

averagingModel dense; :pre

[Examples:]

averagingModel dense; :pre

[Description:]

The averaging model performs the Lagrangian->Eulerian mapping of data (e.g.
particle velocities). In the "cfdemParticle cloud" this averaging model is used
to calculate the average particle velocity inside a CFD cell. The {dense} model
is supposed to be applied to cases where the granular regime is rather dense. 

[Restrictions:]

No known restrictions.
