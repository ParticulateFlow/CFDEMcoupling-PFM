smoothingModel temporalSmoothing command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in dictionary depending on the application.

smoothingModel temporalSmoothing;
temporalSmoothingProps
\{
    lowerLimit number1;
    upperLimit number2;
    refField   referenceField;
    gamma      smoothingStrength;
\} :pre

{number1} = scalar fields will be bound to this lower value :ulb,l
{number2} = scalar fields will be bound to this upper value :l
{referenceField} = reference to the un-smoothed field required for the relaxation operation :l
{smoothingStrength} = control parameter for the smoothing, lower value yields stronger smoothing (gamma = 1 results in an equal contribution from the un-smoothed and smoothed fields)  :l
:ule

[Examples:]

temporalSmoothingProps
\{
    lowerLimit     0.1;
    upperLimit     1e10;
    referenceField "p";
    gamma          1.0;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The {temporalSmoothing} model is a smoothing model that utilizes temporal
relaxation of a desired quantity. This model can be used to filter out
high-frequency fluctuations (e.g. numerical noise) controlled via the control
parameter gamma.
Note that this model does NOT smooth the calculated fields, instead smoothing is
performed on a separate (smooth) field which uses the calculated (un-smooth)
field as a reference.
Thus its usage is limited and CANNOT be used to smooth the exchange fields
similar to other smoothing models.
For further information see Vångö et al., "Unresolved CFD-DEM modeling of
multiphase flow in densely packed particle beds", Appl. Math. Model. (2018).

[Restrictions:]

This model does NOT smooth the calculated fields and can therefore NOT be used
as a general smoothing model to smoothen the exchange fields.
Attempting this will generate an error.
