locateModel engineSearchMany2Many command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

locateModel engineSearchMany2Many;
engineSearchMany2ManyProps
\{
    engineProps
    \{
        treeSearch switch1;
    \}
\}  :pre

{switch1} = switch to use tree search algorithm
:ule

[Examples:]

locateModel engineSearchMany2Many;
engineSearchMany2ManyProps
\{
    engineProps
    \{
        treeSearch true;
    \}
\} :pre

[Description:]

The locateModel "engine" locates the CFD cell and cellID corresponding to a
given position.
This model is a dummy for the
"twoWayMany2Many dataExchangeModel"_dataExchangeModel_twoWayMany2Many.html which
locates using the specified "engine" during coupling.

NOTE: Using this model with any other dataExchangeModel will cause problems.

The {engineSearchMany2Many} locateModel can be used with different settings to
use different algorithms:

treeSearch false;  will execute some geometric (linear) search using the last
known cellID (recommended) :ulb,l
treeSearch true;   will use a recursive tree structure to find the cell. :l
:ule

[Restrictions:]

Use only with the twoWayMany2Many dataExchangeModel!
