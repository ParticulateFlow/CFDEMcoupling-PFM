2. Installation :link(1_2),h3

In order to get the latest code version, please use the git repository at
"http://github.com"_https://github.com/ParticulateFlow.


2.1 Installing OpenFOAM :h4

2.1.1 Obtain a copy of the source code :h5

In the CFDEMcoupling repository take a look at the file

src/lagrangian/cfdemParticle/cfdTools/versionInfo.H :pre

to find out the latest tested version of LIGGGHTS and OpenFOAM that work with
CFDEMcoupling. As of this writing the version of OpenFOAM to be used is 4.x.

You can then basically follow the instructions at
"openfoam.org"_https://openfoam.org/download/source/, cloning OpenFOAM from the
git repository.

cd $HOME
mkdir OpenFOAM
cd OpenFOAM
git clone https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-4.x.git :pre

Clone the corresponding third party packages to the OpenFOAM folder.

git clone https://github.com/OpenFOAM/ThirdParty-4.x.git :pre

Switch to root user with sudo

sudo su - :pre

Install dependent packages required for OpenFOAM on Ubuntu by executing the
following commands:

apt-get install build-essential flex bison cmake zlib1g-dev libboost-system-dev libboost-thread-dev libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin gnuplot libreadline-dev libncurses-dev libxt-dev
apt-get install qt4-dev-tools libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev freeglut3-dev libqtwebkit-dev
apt-get install libcgal-dev :pre

2.1.2 Setup the environment :h5

Open your bash startup file

NOTE: Don't forget the dot before the file name of {.bashrc}

gedit ~/.bashrc :pre

and add the following lines:

source $HOME/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-4.x/etc/bashrc
export WM_NCOMPPROCS=4 :pre

Save the file and reload it:

source ~/.bashrc :pre

:line

[Additional check]

Open ~/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-4.x/etc/bashrc and make sure that {WM_MPLIB} is set
correctly:

export WM_MPLIB=SYSTEMOPENMPI :pre

This should be the default setting but if you encounter some problems regarding
MPI you might have to download the openmpi-1.10.2 source package to the third
party folder and change the setting to {OPENMPI}

:line


2.1.3 Compile ThirdParty packages :h5

cd $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR
./Allwmake :pre


[Compiling Paraview and the Paraview Reader Module]

Paraview is a third-party software provided for graphical post-processing in
OpenFOAM. Its compilation is automated using a script called makeParaView in the
ThirdParty-4.x directory.

Before installing Paraview, check the version of cmake that is installed on the
system. This can be done by typing

cmake --version :pre

If the system cmake is older than version 2.8.8, clone a newer version to the
Third Party folder and compile it by executing the following:

cd $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR
git clone https://github.com/Kitware/CMake.git cmake-3.2.1
cd cmake-3.2.1
git checkout tags/v3.2.1
cd ..
./makeCmake :pre

In makeParaView set the path to cmake:

CMAKE_PATH="$WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR/platforms/linux64Gcc/cmake-3.2.1/bin" :pre

To install Paraview, execute the following

cd $WM_THIRD_PARTY_DIR
./makeParaView :pre

If you get the following error


VTK/ThirdParty/hdf5/vtkhdf5/src/H5detect.c:158:1: error: unknown type name ‘sigjmp_buf’
static H5JMP_BUF jbuf_g; :pre

in VTK/ThirdParty/hdf5/vtkhdf5/config/cmake/ConfigureChecks.cmake around line 445 change

set (HDF5_EXTRA_FLAGS -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE) :pre

to

set (HDF5_EXTRA_FLAGS -D_GNU_SOURCE -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -D_BSD_SOURCE) :pre


2.1.4 Compile OpenFOAM :h5

[Compiling the source code]

cd $WM_PROJECT_DIR
./Allwmake :pre


[Testing the installation]

Create a project directory within the $HOME/OpenFOAM directory

mkdir -p $FOAM_RUN :pre

Copy the tutorial examples directory in the OpenFOAM distribution to the run
directory. If the OpenFOAM environment variables are set correctly, then the
following command will be correct:

cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS $FOAM_RUN :pre

Run the first example case of incompressible laminar flow in a cavity:

cd $FOAM_RUN/tutorials/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity/cavity
blockMesh
icoFoam
paraFoam :pre


2.2 Installing CFDEMcoupling :h4

Make sure OpenFOAM is set up correctly and LIGGGHTS is installed as well. Clone
the CFDEMcoupling source from the repository:

cd $HOME
mkdir CFDEM
cd CFDEM
git clone https://github.com/ParticulateFlow/CFDEMcoupling.git :pre

Open the bashrc file of CFDEMcoupling

gedit ~/CFDEM/CFDEMcoupling/etc/bashrc & :pre

Edit the lines marked as {USER EDITABLE PART} to reflect your installation paths
correctly. Save the bashrc file and reload it:

source ~/CFDEM/CFDEMcoupling/etc/bashrc :pre

Entering $CFDEM_PROJECT_DIR in a the terminal should now give "... is a directory"

Check if everything is set up correctly:

cfdemSysTest :pre

Compile LIGGGHTS (as a library)

cfdemCompLIG :pre

If the compilation fails with a message like

No rule to make target '/usr/lib/libpython2.7.so' :pre

you probably need to create a symbolic link to the library in question.

Compile CFDEMcoupling (library, solvers and utilities) in one go

cfdemCompCFDEM :pre

or alternatively step by step

cfdemCompCFDEMsrc
cfdemCompCFDEMsol
cfdemCompCFDEMuti :pre

Find the log files of the compile process

cd ~/CFDEM/CFDEMcoupling/etc/log
ls :pre

If the file [log_compile_results_success] is present, compilation was successful.

Install Octave for post-processing some of the tutorial output.

sudo apt-get install octave :pre

To run all tutorial cases type in a terminal:

cfdemTestTUT :pre
