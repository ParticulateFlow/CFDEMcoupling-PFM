[Description:]

<!-- HTML_ONLY -->
"cfdemSolverRhoPimple" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using the CFDEMcoupling
framework. Based on the OpenFOAM&reg;(*) solver rhoPimpleFoam, this is a
transient solver for compressible flow using the flexible PIMPLE (PISO-SIMPLE)
algorithm, coupled with the DEM code LIGGGHTS for solid particles.
