dataExchangeModel twoWayFiles command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

dataExchangeModel twoWayFiles;
twoWayFilesProps
\{
    couplingFilename        "filename";
    maxNumberOfParticles    scalar1;
    DEMts                   scalar2;
\} :pre

{filename} = filename of the VTK file series :ulb,l
{scalar1} = maximum number of particles in DEM simulation :l
{scalar2} = DEM time step width :l
:ule

[Examples:]

dataExchangeModel twoWayFiles;
twoWayFilesProps
\{
    couplingFilename        "vtk_out%4.4d.vtk";
    maxNumberOfParticles    30000;
\} :pre

[Description:]

The data exchange model performs the data exchange between the DEM code and the
CFD code. The {twoWayFiles} model is a model that can exchange particle
properties from DEM to CFD and from CFD to DEM. Data is exchanged via files that
are sequentially written/read by the codes.

[Restrictions:]

Developed only for two processors, one for DEM and one for CFD run.
