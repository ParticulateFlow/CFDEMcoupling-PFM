cfdemSolverPiso command :h3

[Description:]

<!-- HTML_ONLY -->
"cfdemSolverPiso" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using CFDEMcoupling, an open-\
source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework. Based on pisoFoam&reg;(*), a finite
volume based solver for turbulent Navier-Stokes equations applying the PISO
algorithm, "cfdemSolverPiso" has additional functionality for a coupling to the
DEM code "LIGGGHTS".

The volume averaged Navier-Stokes Equations are solved accounting for momentum
exchange and volume displacement of discrete particles whose trajectories are
calculated in the DEM code LIGGGHTS.
