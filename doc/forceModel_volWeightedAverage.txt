forceModel volWeightedAverage command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in "couplingProperties"_CFDEMcoupling_dicts.html#couplingProperties
dictionary.

forceModels
(
    volWeightedAverage
);
volWeightedAverageProps
\{
    startTime time;
    scalarFieldNames
    (
        scalarField
    );
    vectorFieldNames
    (
        vectorField
    );
    upperThreshold     scalar1;
    lowerThreshold     scalar2;
    verbose;
\} :pre

{time} = (optional, default 0.) time to start the averaging :ulb,l
{scalarField} = names of the finite volume scalar fields to be temporally averaged :l
{vectorField} = names of the finite volume vector fields to be temporally averaged :l
{scalar1} = only cells with a field value (magnitude) lower than this upper threshold are considered :l
{scalar2} = only cells with a field value (magnitude) greater than this lower threshold are considered :l
{verbose} = (optional, default false) keyword only (mostly used for debugging) :l
:ule

[Examples:]

forceModels
(
    volWeightedAverage
);
volWeightedAverageProps
\{
    startTime 0.1;
    scalarFieldNames
    (
        voidfraction
    );
    vectorFieldNames
    (
    );
    upperThreshold 0.999;
    lowerThreshold 0;
\} :pre

[Description:]

This "forceModel" does not influence the particles or the simulation - it is a
post-processing tool! Starting at start time the volume weighted averages of
those cells of the fields within the threshold are calculated.

At "writeTime" a field named volAverage_field, where scalarField is the name of
the original field, is written. This can then be probed using standard function
object probes.

[Restrictions:]

Currently all fields have the same threshold value!
