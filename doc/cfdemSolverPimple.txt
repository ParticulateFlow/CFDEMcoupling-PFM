cfdemSolverPimple command :h3

[Description:]

<!-- HTML_ONLY -->
"cfdemSolverPimple" is a coupled CFD-DEM solver using CFDEMcoupling, an open-\
source parallel coupled CFD-DEM framework. Based on DPMFoam&reg;(*), a finite
volume based solver for turbulent Navier-Stokes equations applying the PIMPLE
algorithm, "cfdemSolverPimple" has additional functionality for a coupling to the
DEM code "LIGGGHTS".
