Test case for fines transport through packed particle column

1) fill a cylinder with sperical particles (parDEMrun.sh)
2) create CFD mesh (mesh.sh)
3) introduce gas flow with fines (parCFDDEMrun.sh)


Comments:

After particles have settled, they remain frozen to their positions.
The pressure drop can be monitored with postProcessing/probes1/0/p. When all small pores in the particle bed are clogged, no further deposition takes place and the pressure drop does not increase any further.
